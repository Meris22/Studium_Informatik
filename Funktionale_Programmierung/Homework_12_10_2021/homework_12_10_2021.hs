-- Aufgabe 1 
-- 1.1 0 :: Bool --> 0 is not a Bool because it is a number!
-- 1.2 head "test" : Char --> Head gives back the first character of a string and "t" is a Char!
-- 1.3 'hello' :: String --> is not a string because of the wrong quotation marks!
-- 1.4 plus1 :: Integer -> Integer --> Not valid, because plus1 does take the input float as well!
