What is the difference between shared memory and e.g. a global variable after calling fork()?
	Shared memory is shared realtime; global variables will just be copied;

What is a race condition?
	Two or more threads racing/running againt each other accessign some data

Why do race conditions occur?
	Because multiple threads access the same data and try to nteract with it

Is the output of a program with a race condition always incorrect?
	No, it's dependent on the schedule of the threads

If you run your program 100 times and always get the correct result, does that mean that there is no race condition?
	No it can occur on a diferent computer because the scheduler works different on that computer

What is synchronization?
	Synchronization is the coordination of threads and processes in a way that at no time
	more than 1 process can access the same shared data

Why are semaphores well suited for synchronizing producer-consumer patterns?
	Because they can block and unblock synchroniously


There are two ways of creating a POSIX semaphore. Which would you use when?
	sem_init(): unnamed semaphores for communication between threads;
	sem_open: named semaphore for interprocess communication

Could Task 2 also be implemented using a single semaphore?
    yes, look at my solution in task 2 commented below!
