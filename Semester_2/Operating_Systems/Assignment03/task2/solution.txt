Summary:
    read a lot about strace!
    first, make the file executable!
    second, make sure you see all the syscalls! (use strace -c and make sure you had the ./ before the file)
    third, investigate the behaviour of the program. You can't change it because normally you don't have acces to the source code!
    fourth, retrace calls that give errors! strace -c is a good option to first get an overview and then use the -e trace=YOURCHOICE
    fifth, look into the paths!
