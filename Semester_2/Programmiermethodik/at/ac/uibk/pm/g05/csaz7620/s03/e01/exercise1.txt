Exercise 1 (Visibility)
Describe in your own words what the difference between private and public variables and methods is
and what they are used for. In this context, also describe the usage of this.
    public means that you can access it anywhere while private means that you can only access it inside its own class!
    this is referred to the local private variable and not the parameter of the function! (Usefully for setter)
