a) In the main method, where mcc1a is created, an integer and a float literal are passed where
the constructor expects something of type Integer and Double, respectively. At the instantiation of mcc1b, the int variable int17 is passed where the constructor expects something of
type Integer. Why does this work? Which mechanism in Java is used to handle such cases?

This works with the Autoboxing.
The Compiler changes automatically the type.

This works with the Wrapper Classes so the Compiler changes automatically the type.

b)At the definition of mcc1c and mcc1d in the main method, a value of type Integer is passed
where the constructor expects an value of data type int. Explain how Java handles this case
and which mechanism is used to make this work.

This works with the Autoboxing.
The Compiler changes automatically the type.
